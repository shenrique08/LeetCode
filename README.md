# 🧠 LeetCode Practice

Welcome to my LeetCode practice repository! This is where I regularly solve problems to improve my understanding of **algorithms** and **data structures**, with most solutions written in **Java**.

---

## 📁 Structure

The problems are organized bydifficulty and topic:



Each folder contains:
- `Solution.java` &&/|| `OptimizedSolution.java` – clean and well-documented code
---

## ✅ Goals

- Improve problem-solving speed
- Prepare for technical interviews
- Master Java and core CS concepts

---

## 🚀 How to Run

Make sure you have Java installed. Then, compile and run any solution like this:

```bash
javac Solution.java
java Solution
